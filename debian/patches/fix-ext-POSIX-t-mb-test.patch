Subject: Fix edge case test failure in ext/POSIX/t/mb.t

This new test fails in an environment where LANG is set to one thing and
LC_ALL is set to another, and where LANG is set to a locale which is
not installed in the environment in question.

Such a test environment is arguably broken, but appears in common
chroot setups such as Debian's sbuild tool where LANG is inherited from
the parent environment, and LC_ALL is used to override it.
